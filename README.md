# Online_Store

An online store made as part of my web development internship at BitStone, made up of two components:  
- [The web client](https://github.com/tomsaalex/Shop-Project-React)  
  Made in React. It provides the interface with the API exposed by the server, allowing a user to browse the store's products, access their account and add products to their shopping cart before checking them out.
- [The server](https://github.com/tomsaalex/Shop-Project-Backend)  
  Made using Node.js. It handles the authentication logic of the web site, as well as keeping track of each user's shopping cart and persisting all relevant data to a NoSQL database.
